The goal of *circumplex* is to provide a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly way to analyze and visualize circumplex data. It was created and is maintained by [Jeffrey Girard](https://jmgirard.com/), and was inspired by work from and was developed in conjunction with [Johannes Zimmermann](https://psychologische-hochschule.de/prof-dr-johannes-zimmermann/) and [Aidan Wright](https://personalityprocesses.com/). You can learn more about using this package through the vignette articles available on the [package website](https://circumplex.jmgirard.com/) or through `?circumplex`.

## Installation

``` r
# Install release version from CRAN
install.packages("circumplex")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("jmgirard/circumplex")
```

## Usage

```{r analysis1}
data("jz2017")
results <- ssm_analyze(
  .data = jz2017, 
  scales = c(PA, BC, DE, FG, HI, JK, LM, NO), 
  angles = c(90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315, 360, 45), 
  measures = c(NARPD, ASPD)
)
```

``` r
ssm_table(results)
```

```{r table1, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
ssm_table(results, render = FALSE) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = circumplex:::dcaption(results)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12)
```

```{r plot}
ssm_plot(results)
```
