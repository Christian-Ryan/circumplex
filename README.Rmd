[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmgirard/circumplex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmgirard/circumplex) [![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/jmgirard/circumplex/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/jmgirard/circumplex?branch=master) [![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)


## Overview

The goal of *circumplex* is to provide a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly way to analyze and visualize circumplex data. It was created and is maintained by [Jeffrey Girard](https://jmgirard.com/), and was inspired by work from and was developed in conjunction with [Johannes Zimmermann](https://psychologische-hochschule.de/prof-dr-johannes-zimmermann/) and [Aidan Wright](https://personalityprocesses.com/).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmgirard/circumplex")
```

## Usage

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(12345)
```

```{r analysis1}
data("jz2017")
results <- ssm_analyze(
  .data = jz2017, 
  scales = c(PA, BC, DE, FG, HI, JK, LM, NO), 
  angles = c(90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315, 360, 45), 
  measures = c(NARPD, ASPD)
)
```

``` r
ssm_table(results)
```

```{r table1, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
ssm_table(results, render = FALSE) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = circumplex:::dcaption(results)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE, font_size = 12)
```

```{r plot}
ssm_plot(results)
```

## Lifecycle

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-maturing-blue.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#maturing)

Although a full suite of functions for conducting and visualizing the Structural Summary Method is available, circumplex is a relatively young package and new functionality is planned for the future. Some functions and arguments may change as the design philosophy is fully fleshed out, but this will be done carefully and with backward-compatibility in mind.
