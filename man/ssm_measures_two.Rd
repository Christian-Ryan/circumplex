\title{Correlational Comparison Structural Summary Method}
\usage{
ssm_measures_two(.data, angles, boots, interval)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A matrix or data frame containing exactly two measure variables
and any number of circumplex scales.}

\item{angles}{A numerical vector containing the angular displacement of each
circumplex scale included in \code{.data} (in degrees).}

\item{boots}{The number of bootstrap resamples to use in calculating the
confidence intervals.}

\item{interval}{The confidence intervals' percentage level.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing SSM parameters (point and interval estimates) for
  the difference between two measures (based on correlations).
}
\description{
Worker function for ssm_measures, calculates point and interval estimates for
the difference between two measures' correlational SSM parameters.
