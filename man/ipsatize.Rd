\title{Ipsatize circumplex items using deviation scoring across variables}
\usage{
ipsatize(.data, items, na.rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Required. A data frame containing at least circumplex scales.}

\item{items}{Required. The variable names or column numbers for the
variables in \code{.data} that contain circumplex items to be ipsatized.}

\item{na.rm}{Optional. A logical that determines whether missing values
should be ignored during the calculation of the mean during ipsatization.}
}
\value{
A data frame that matches \code{.data} except that new variables are
appended that contain ipsatized versions of \code{items}. These new
variables will have the same name as \code{items} but with a "_i" suffix.
}
\description{
Rescore each circumplex item using deviation scoring across variables. In
other words, subtract each observation's mean response from each response.
This effectively removes the presence of a general factor, which can make
certain circumplex fit analyses more powerful.
