\title{Standardize Circumplex Scales using Normative Data}
\usage{
ssm_standardize(.data, scales, angles, norms)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A matrix or data frame containing at least circumplex scales.}

\item{scales}{A list of the variables or column numbers in \code{.data} that
contain circumplex scales (in tidyverse-style NSE specification).}

\item{angles}{A numerical vector containing the angular displacement of each
circumplex scale included in \code{scales} (in degrees).}

\item{norms}{A data frame containing normative data for the circumplex scales
you would like to standardize. Normative data is included in the package
for several popular circumplex measures.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing normalized versions of the variables
specified in \code{scales}, as well as any additional variables that were
included in \code{.data}.
