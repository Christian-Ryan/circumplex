\title{Standardize Circumplex Scales using Normative Data}
\usage{
standardize(.data, scales, angles = NULL, norms = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A matrix or data frame containing at least circumplex scales
(note that \code{.data} should contain mean scores and not sum scores if
the included normative data is to be used).}

\item{scales}{A list of the variables or column numbers in \code{.data} that
contain circumplex scales (in tidyverse-style NSE specification).}

\item{angles}{Optional: A numerical vector containing the angular
displacement of each circumplex scale included in \code{scales} (in
degrees). Only necessary when norms are provided (default = NULL).}

\item{norms}{Optional: A data frame containing normative data for the
circumplex scales you would like to standardize. Normative data is included
in the package for several popular circumplex measures. If \code{norms} is
not specified or if it is set to NULL, the data will be standardized so
that its observed mean is equal to 0 and its observed standard deviation is
equal to 1 (default = NULL).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing normalized versions of the variables
specified in \code{scales}, as well as any additional variables that were
included in \code{.data}.
}
\description{
Takes in a data frame containing circumplex scales (and possibly other
variables) and returns that same data frame with the following changes: the
circumplex scales will be standardized either using external normative data
(if specified) or using the observed data (if not specified) and the
circumplex scales will be moved to be the first variables.
