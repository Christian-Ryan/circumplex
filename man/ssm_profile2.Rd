\title{Mean Profile Comparison Structural Summary Method}
\usage{
ssm_profile2(data, groups, scales, angles, bs_number = 2000)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A matrix or data frame containing circumplex scales and group
membership.}

\item{scales}{A vector that contains the column names in \code{data} that
correspond to scores on each circumplex scale. Be sure to enter the names
as is (i.e., not as strings or a character vector). For convenience,
consecutive columns can be captured using a colon (e.g., \code{x1:x8}).}

\item{angles}{A vector of angles, in degrees, of the circumplex scales.}

\item{bs_number}{The number of bootstrap resamples (default = 2000).}

\item{group}{The column name in \code{data} that specifies each observation's
group. Be sure to enter the name as is (i.e., not as a string or number).
This variable can be a factor with two levels or a numeric or character
variable with two unique values.}
}
\value{
A tibble (data frame) containing estimates and bootstrapped 95\%
  confidence intervals for the mean profile's structural summary parameters:
  elevation, x-value, y-value, amplitude, displacement, and model fit.
}
\description{
Calculate SSM parameters with bootstrapped confidence intervals for the mean
profile of two groups in a sample and their difference.
