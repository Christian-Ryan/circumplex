\title{Calculate difference between two angular displacements}
\usage{
disp_diff(d1, d2)
}
\arguments{
\item{d1, d2}{Angular displacements (in degrees).}
}
\value{
The difference (in degrees) between \code{d1} and \code{d2}. Positive
  and negative differences indicate that to move from \code{d1} to \code{d2},
  you would need to move clockwise and counter-clockwise around the
  circumference, respectively. Note that currently differences of 180 and
  -180 are both represented as -180, which may cause problems when
  calculating the bootstrap confidence interval.
