\title{Gap Test of equal spacing}
\usage{
fit_gap(.data, scales, ridge = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Required. A data frame containing at least circumplex scales.}

\item{scales}{Required. The variable names or column numbers for the
variables in \code{.data} that contain circumplex scales to be analyzed.}

\item{ridge}{Optional. A double representing the ridge constant to be added
to the diagonal of the correlation matrix to address non-positive-definite
correlation matrix (default = 0). If this argument is non-zero, then the
factor method is also set to maximum likelihood.}
}
\value{
A list containing the results and description of the analysis.
\item{stat}{A double containing the estimated test statistic}
\item{loadings}{The loading matrix from the factor analysis}
\item{angles}{The estimated angle of each scale in the unrotated factor
analysis (in radians), sorted (it is good to check that the theoretical
ordering of the scales has been preserved)}
\item{gaps}{The difference between each adjacent scale's angles (used in
calculated the test statistic)}
\item{details}{A list containing the sample size (n), the ridge constant
(ridge), the factor method (fm), and the type of fit analysis (type).}
\item{call}{A language object containing the function call that created
this object}
}
\description{
Conduct the Gap Test of equal spacing. The test will have the most power if
the items have been ipsatized first. See the \code{ipsatize} function.
Simulation studies suggest that values less than 0.03 almost certainly
indicate equal axes, whereas test values less than 0.05 indicate that equal
axes are twice as likely as non-equal axes.
