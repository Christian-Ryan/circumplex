\title{Calculate angular distance}
\usage{
angle_dist(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Angles in degree or radian units.}
}
\value{
The shortest distance between \code{x} and \code{y} in the same
units, where positive numbers mean \code{x} is more counterclockwise than
\code{y} and negative numbers mean the opposite. Note that, given how the
distance is calculated, when \code{x} and \code{y} are exactly 180 degrees
or pi radians apart, the distance output will be arbitrarily negative.
