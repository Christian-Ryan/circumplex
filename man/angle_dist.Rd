\title{Calculate angular distance}
\usage{
angle_dist(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Angles in radian units.}
}
\value{
The shortest distance between \code{x} and \code{y} in radians, where
positive numbers mean \code{x} is more counterclockwise than \code{y} and
negative numbers mean the opposite. Note that, given how the distance is
calculated, when \code{x} and \code{y} are exactly pi radians apart, the
distance output will be arbitrarily negative.
