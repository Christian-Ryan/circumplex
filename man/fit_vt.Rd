\title{Variance Test of interstitiality}
\usage{
fit_vt(.data, scales)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Required. A data frame containing at least circumplex scales.}

\item{scales}{Required. The variable names or column numbers for the
variables in \code{.data} that contain circumplex scales to be analyzed.}
}
\value{
A double
}
\description{
Conduct the Variance Test of interstitiality (sometimes called VT2). The test
will have the most power if the items have been ipsatized first. See the
\code{ipsatize} function. It is also best in the absence of a general factor.
Simulation studies suggest that test values less that 0.40 almost certainly
indicate interstitiality, test values less than 0.48 indicate that
interstitiality is three times as likely as non-interstitiality, and test
values less than 0.65 indicate that interstitiality is twice as likely as
non-interstitiality.
