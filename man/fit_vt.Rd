\title{Variance Test of indifference to rotation}
\usage{
fit_vt(.data, scales, ridge = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Required. A data frame containing at least circumplex scales.}

\item{scales}{Required. The variable names or column numbers for the
variables in \code{.data} that contain circumplex scales to be analyzed.}

\item{ridge}{Optional. A double representing the ridge constant to be added
to the diagonal of the correlation matrix to address non-positive-definite
correlation matrix (default = 0). Omit or set ridge to zero in order to
use principal axis factor analysis with no ridge constant. Set ridge to a
positive number in order to use maximum likelihood factor analysis with a
ridge constant.}
}
\value{
A list containing the results and description of the analysis.
\item{stat}{A double containing the estimated test statistic}
\item{loadings}{The loading matrix from the factor analysis}
\item{criteria}{The estimated "fit" criterion for each arbitrary rotation
(used in calculating the test statistic)}
\item{details}{A list containing the sample size (n), the ridge constant
(ridge), the factor method (fm), and the type of fit analysis (type).}
\item{call}{A language object containing the function call that created
this object}
}
\description{
Conduct the Variance Test of indifference to rotation (sometimes called VT2).
The test will have the most power if the items have been ipsatized first.
See the \code{ipsatize} function. It is also best in the absence of a general
factor. Simulation studies suggest that test values less that 0.40 almost
certainly indicate interstitiality, test values less than 0.48 indicate that
interstitiality is three times as likely as non-interstitiality, and test
values less than 0.65 indicate that interstitiality is twice as likely as
non-interstitiality.
