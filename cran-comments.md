## Resubmission
This is a resubmission intended to return the package from being archived. In this version I have:

* Fixed check errors in development R by explicitly setting the RNG version in seeded tets
* Modified some code to avoid calling a function that is being deprecated by a dependency

## Test environments
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.1
* win-builder (devel, release, and oldrelease)

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
