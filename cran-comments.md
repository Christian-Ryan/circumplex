## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed a bug on solaris systems related to use of the pow() function

* Changed to depend on R (>= 3.4.0) to enable testing on r-oldrel machines

## Test environments
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* "Days since last update: 5": This resubmission fixes CRAN check errors from
the previous submission and was requested by CRAN administrators.

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
